DCA STI.R contains the codes to backtest the returns to dollar cost averaging into the STI with and without the reinvestment of dividends

DCA US ETF.R contains the codes for a simplified backtesting (where it is assumed that there are no dividends received) of the returns to dollar cost averaging into the S&P500
